# Bash Scripting, Node.js Installation, and Advanced Text Processing (grep, sed, awk)

## Overview
This guide covers three exciting topics in Bash and development: **Bash Scripting**, **Installing Node.js**, and **Advanced Text Processing** with `grep`, `sed`, and `awk`. These are like superpowers for controlling your computer, running programs, and working with text. Bash (Bourne Again Shell) lets you type commands in a **terminal** to automate tasks, install tools, and process data. This guide is written to be clear while providing detailed steps for practical use.


- **Terminal:** The app where you type Bash commands (e.g., Terminal on macOS/Linux or Git Bash on Windows).
- **Why use these tools?** They help you automate tasks, set up programming environments, and process text like a pro.

## Topics Covered
Let’s dive into **Bash Scripting**, **Installing Node.js**, and **Advanced Text Processing** with `grep`, `sed`, and `awk`. Each section is like a new tool in your Bash toolbox!

### 1. Bash Scripting
- **What it is:** Bash scripting is like writing a recipe for your computer. You put a bunch of commands in a file, and Bash runs them one by one to do tasks automatically.
- **How it works:** Create a file (e.g., `script.sh`) starting with `#!/bin/bash`, followed by Bash commands. Make the file executable and run it.
- **Syntax:**
  - Start with the **shebang**: `#!/bin/bash` (tells the computer this is a Bash script).
  - Add commands, one per line, like `echo`, `ls`, or `mkdir`.
- **Example:**
  Create a file called `hello.sh`:
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  echo "Hello, Bash!"
  mkdir new_folder
  ls
  ```
  - Save the file.
  - Make it executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x hello.sh
    ```
  - Run it:
    ```bash
    ./hello.sh
    ```
    Output: `Hello, Bash!` followed by a list of files, and a new folder called `new_folder` is created.
- **More features:**
  - **Variables:** Store values like `name="Alice"; echo "Hi, $name!"` (prints `Hi, Alice!`).
  - **Loops:** Repeat tasks, e.g., `for i in 1 2 3; do echo $i; done` (prints `1`, `2`, `3`).
  - **Conditionals:** Make decisions, e.g., `if [ -d new_folder ]; then echo "Folder exists!"; fi`.
- **Why it’s useful:** Saves time by automating repetitive tasks, like organizing files or running commands.
- **Try it:** Create a script called `test.sh` with:
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  echo "My first script!"
  touch test_file.txt
  ls
  ```
  Run `chmod +x test.sh` and `./test.sh` to see it work.

### 2. Installing Node.js
- **What it is:** Node.js is a tool that lets you run JavaScript programs on your computer, like building websites or apps. Installing it means setting it up so you can use it in your terminal.
- **How it works:** You download and install Node.js using a package manager or installer, depending on your operating system. Below are detailed steps for **Ubuntu Linux**, **macOS**, and **Windows**.
- **Steps by Operating System:**
  #### Ubuntu Linux (Using Package Manager)
  1. Open the terminal.
  2. Update package lists:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     ```
  3. Install `curl` (if not installed):
     ```bash
     sudo apt install curl
     ```
  4. Add Node.js repository (for the latest version, e.g., Node.js 20.x as of May 2025):
     ```bash
     curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
     ```
  5. Install Node.js (includes `npm`, the Node.js package manager):
     ```bash
     sudo apt install -y nodejs
     ```
  6. Verify installation:
     ```bash
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```
     Output: Shows versions (e.g., `v20.15.0` for Node.js, `10.8.1` for npm).
  #### macOS (Using Homebrew)
  1. Open the terminal.
  2. Install Homebrew (if not installed):
     ```bash
     /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
     ```
  3. Update Homebrew:
     ```bash
     brew update
     ```
  4. Install Node.js:
     ```bash
     brew install node
     ```
  5. Verify installation:
     ```bash
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```
     Output: Shows versions (e.g., `v20.15.0` for Node.js, `10.8.1` for npm).
  #### Windows (Using Installer)
  1. Open a web browser and go to `https://nodejs.org/`.
  2. Download the **LTS** version (e.g., 20.x as of May 2025) for Windows.
  3. Run the installer (e.g., `node-v20.15.0-x64.msi`).
  4. Follow the setup wizard:
     - Accept the license.
     - Choose the installation path (default is fine).
     - Check “Automatically install necessary tools” (includes `npm`).
  5. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
  6. Verify installation:
     ```bash
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```
     Output: Shows versions (e.g., `v20.15.0` for Node.js, `10.8.1` for npm).
- **Troubleshooting:**
  - **Permission errors:** Use `sudo` on Linux/macOS or run the terminal as Administrator on Windows.
  - **Old versions:** Ensure you’re using the latest repository or installer from `nodejs.org`.
  - **Path issues:** If `node` or `npm` isn’t found, restart the terminal or reboot your computer.
- **Why it’s useful:** Node.js lets you run JavaScript programs, build web servers, or use tools like React or Express.
- **Try it:** After installing, run `node -e "console.log('Hello, Node.js!')"` to print `Hello, Node.js!`.

### 3. Advanced Text Processing: grep, sed, and awk
These commands are like super-smart librarians who can search, edit, or summarize text in files.

#### grep (Global Regular Expression Print)
- **What it does:** Searches for a word or pattern in a file, like finding a specific toy in a toy box.
- **How it works:** Prints lines that match the given pattern.
- **Syntax:** `grep [options] "pattern" <file>`
- **Example:**
  ```bash
  grep "error" log.txt
  ```
  Output: Shows lines in `log.txt` containing “error” (e.g., `2025-05-02: Error occurred`).
- **Options:**
  - `-i`: Ignores case (e.g., “Error” and “error” match).
    ```bash
    grep -i "error" log.txt
    ```
  - `-n`: Shows line numbers.
    ```bash
    grep -n "error" log.txt
    ```
    Output: `10:2025-05-02: Error occurred` (line 10).
  - `-r`: Searches recursively in all files in a directory.
    ```bash
    grep -r "error" .
    ```
- **Why it’s useful:** Quickly finds specific text in files, like errors in logs or keywords in code.
- **Try it:** Create a file with `echo -e "cat\nDog\nbird" > animals.txt`, then run `grep "Dog" animals.txt`.

#### sed (Stream Editor)
- **What it does:** Edits text by replacing, deleting, or modifying lines, like using a magic eraser to change words.
- **How it works:** Processes text line by line, often used for find-and-replace.
- **Syntax:** `sed [options] "s/pattern/replace/" <file>`
- **Example:**
  ```bash
  sed "s/cat/dog/" animals.txt
  ```
  Output: Replaces “cat” with “dog” in each line (e.g., `dog`, `Dog`, `bird`) but doesn’t change the file.
- **More uses:**
  - Save changes to a file:
    ```bash
    sed -i "s/cat/dog/" animals.txt
    ```
    Modifies `animals.txt` directly.
  - Delete lines:
    ```bash
    sed "/bird/d" animals.txt
    ```
    Removes lines containing “bird”.
- **Options:**
  - `-i`: Edits the file in place.
  - `-r`: Uses extended regular expressions.
- **Why it’s useful:** Automates text edits, like fixing typos or formatting data.
- **Try it:** Use the `animals.txt` file, then run `sed "s/Dog/puppy/" animals.txt` to see the output.

#### awk (Pattern Scanning and Processing)
- **What it does:** Processes text by splitting lines into fields and performing actions, like picking specific columns from a table.
- **How it works:** Treats each line as a record with fields separated by spaces (by default).
- **Syntax:** `awk '{action}' <file>`
- **Example:**
  ```bash
  awk '{print $1}' data.txt
  ```
  If `data.txt` has `Alice 25 student`, `Bob 30 teacher`, this prints `Alice`, `Bob` (first field of each line).
- **More uses:**
  - Filter rows:
    ```bash
    awk '$2 > 25 {print $1}' data.txt
    ```
    Prints names where the second field (age) is greater than 25 (e.g., `Bob`).
  - Sum a column:
    ```bash
    awk '{sum += $2} END {print sum}' data.txt
    ```
    Output: `55` (sum of ages 25 + 30).
- **Why it’s useful:** Great for extracting or summarizing data, like processing logs or CSV files.
- **Try it:** Create a file with `echo -e "Alice 25\nBob 30" > data.txt`, then run `awk '{print $1}' data.txt`.

## Practical Workflow
Let’s combine these in a fun example, like analyzing a game score file:
1. **Create a Bash script** (`score.sh`):
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   echo "Processing game scores..."
   # Create a sample file
   echo -e "Player1 100 won\nPlayer2 50 lost\nPlayer1 200 won" > scores.txt
   # Count lines
   wc -l scores.txt
   # Search for wins
   grep "won" scores.txt
   # Replace "won" with "victory"
   sed "s/won/victory/" scores.txt > new_scores.txt
   # Extract player names
   awk '{print $1}' new_scores.txt
   ```
   Save, then run:
   ```bash
   chmod +x score.sh
   ./score.sh
   ```
   Output: Shows line count, lines with “won”, and player names from modified file.
2. **Install Node.js** (follow steps above for your OS).
3. **Test Node.js with text processing**:
   Create a JavaScript file (`analyze.js`):
   ```javascript
   console.log("Node.js is ready!");
   ```
   Run:
   ```bash
   node analyze.js
   ```
   Output: `Node.js is ready!`
4. **Use grep, sed, awk in a script**:
   Add to `score.sh`:
   ```bash
   # Find high scores
   awk '$2 > 100 {print $1, $2}' scores.txt
   ```
   Output: `Player1 200` (players with scores over 100).

## Tips and Best Practices
- **Test scripts first:** Run commands individually before adding them to a script.
- **Backup files:** Use `cp` to copy files before using `sed -i` or other commands that modify files.
- **Check Node.js installation:** Always verify with `node -v` and `npm -v` after installing.
- **Simple patterns for `grep`/`sed`:** Start with basic searches/replacements before using complex regular expressions.
- **Practice safely:** Test scripts and commands in a temporary folder (`mkdir test && cd test`).

## Common Pitfalls
- **Script permissions:** If `./script.sh` fails, run `chmod +x script.sh`.
- **Node.js version conflicts:** Ensure no old Node.js versions are installed (remove with `sudo apt remove nodejs` on Ubuntu or `brew uninstall node` on macOS).
- **Empty files:** `grep`, `sed`, or `awk` on empty files produce no output. Check with `cat`.
- **Syntax errors in `awk`:** Use single quotes for actions (e.g., `awk '{print $1}'`) to avoid Bash conflicts.
- **Permission issues:** Use `sudo` for installation or file changes, but double-check commands.

## Going Further
- **Advanced scripting:** Add functions or arguments to scripts (e.g., `./script.sh input.txt`).
- **Node.js projects:** Try `npm init` to start a project and install packages like `express`.
- **Complex text processing:** Learn regular expressions for `grep`/`sed` or `awk`’s `BEGIN`/`END` blocks.
- **Explore related commands:** Try `sort`, `uniq`, or `cut` for more text processing.

## Resources
- **Manual Pages:** Type `man <command>` (e.g., `man grep`, `man sed`, `man awk`) in the terminal.
- **Node.js Docs:** Visit `https://nodejs.org/en/docs/` for JavaScript guides.
- **Online Guides:** LinuxJourney, freeCodeCamp, or The Linux Command Line book.
- **Practice:** Try OverTheWire’s Bandit or HackerRank’s Bash challenges.
