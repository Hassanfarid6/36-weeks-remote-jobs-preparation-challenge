# JavaScript Foundations Roadmap

Welcome to the **JavaScript Foundations** learning path! This repo documents weekly progress and key concepts to build a solid understanding of JavaScript â€” from its fundamentals to advanced asynchronous patterns.

---

## ðŸ“… Week 1.1 | JS Foundations

- Why programming languages matter  
- Interpreted vs Compiled languages  
- Why JavaScript over other languages?  
- Strict vs Dynamic typing  
- Single-threaded nature of JavaScript  
- Simple primitives: variables, loops, conditionals  
- Complex primitives: arrays, objects  
- Functions (declaration, expression, arrow)  
- Callback functions  

---

## ðŸ“… Week 1.2 | Basic JavaScript APIs (Beginners)

- Introduction to built-in JS array methods:
  - `map()`
  - `filter()`
  - `find()`
  - `sort()`
- JavaScript classes  
- Working with objects  

---

## ðŸ“… Week 1.3 | Loops, Functions and Callbacks

- `for`, `while`, `forEach` loops  
- Function declarations & expressions  
- Arrow functions  
- Callback functions and use cases  

---

## ðŸ“… Week 1.4 | Async, Await and Promises

- Synchronous vs Asynchronous JavaScript  
- Introduction to Promises  
- `async` / `await` for cleaner async code  
- Callback Hell vs Promises
